# InfiniteVoxelWork
A voxel workflow integrating Minetest for editing and MagicaVoxel for visualization, with a 256 custom game mode pallette.

# Converter

This implementation reads in a Minetest [RegionExport](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Minetest/RegionExport) exported `.re` format (YAML list with custom header) and exports it into a MagicaVoxelViewer `.xraw` format.

# Notes

* (issue) Currently ExportRegion's output axis is not matching expected MagicaVoxel Viewer orientation - however this concerns byte layout so it's requires a bit thinking to fix it.
* (todo, issue) I think the alpha channel for `.xraw` is not functional?
* (todo, experiment) MagicaVoxel max render range is 2048^2, and very likely MagicaVoxel Viewer won't support advanced node properties - try on Houdini and what kind of rendering setup it can produce, and how much larger it can render.
* (todo, idea) Maybe some sort of Sticher that can combine various pieces together (to overcome export generated block range limit) - in this case we definitely need to keep track of `Pos` of exported blocks and use a post-processing to combine those blocks (and sort them). Â¶However, explore some real art with our current capabilities - the goal shouldn't lie in the tool, but the content.
* (specification) Puretest should have 255 (1 reserved for empty) pure color blocks - along with 255 HHlaf and 255 VHalf blocks (and maybe 255 Stairs, and 255 straight stairs) - those later ones (outside the 255 pure color ones) are entirely for in-game aethetics purpose because during export they will become whole blocks. Apparently to write such a mod we will generate the code instead of hand-write it.
